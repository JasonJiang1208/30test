  title={Predicting direction of stock price index movement using artificial neural networks and support vector machines: The sample of the Istanbul Stock Exchange},
  abstract = {diction. An accurate prediction of stock price movement may yield profits for investors. Due to the comstxplexity of stock market data, development of efficient models for predicting is very difficult. This study attempted to develop two efficient models and compared their performances in predicting the direction of movement in the daily Istanbul Stock Exchange (ISE) National 100 Index. The models are based on two classification techniques, artificial neural networks (ANN) and support vector machines (SVM). Ten technical indicators were selected as inputs of the proposed models. Two comprehensive parameter setting experiments for both models were performed to improve their prediction performances. Experimental results showed that average performance of ANN model (75.74%) was found significantly better than that of SVM model (71.52%).},

  abstract = {From exchanging budgetary instruments to tracking individual spending plans to detail a business's profit, money-related organisations utilise computational innovation day by day. Here in this paper, we focus on the significance of innovation in accounts such as financial risk management and stock prediction. We discuss two significant algorithms that have a notable role in stock forecasting. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), as absenteeism of some data points, does not hamper the network functioning. Secondly, Support Vector Machines (SVM) has several features, and due to simple decision boundaries, it avoids over-fitting. The paper first looks at the different technologies applied in stock market prediction. It examines how sentimental analysis, decision trees, moving average algorithm, and data mining is applied in various stock prediction scenarios. The paper covers the recent past studies to explore the concepts and methodologies through which ANN's and SVM's have been used. Additionally, the paper incorporates significant aspects of novel methods and technologies in which ANN as a hybrid model like ANN-MLP, GARCH-MLP, a combination of the Backpropagation algorithm and Multilayer Feed-forward network, yields better results. Simultaneously, SVM's have been successfully applied in stock prediction, giving an accuracy of about 60%–70% for simple SVM, which is further improved by combining methods like Random Forest, Genetic Algorithm more accurate outcomes. Further, we present our thoughts on where SVM's and ANN's stand as prediction algorithms and challenges like the time constraint, current scenarios, data limitation, and cold start problems were raised. Conclusively SVM and ANN played prominent roles in tackling these issue to an extent and can further be enhanced with their integration with other novel techniques resulting in hybrid methodologies. It will lead students, researchers and financial enthusiasts to more potent approaches for Stock forecasting.},

  title={A comparative study of support vector machine and artificial neural network for option price prediction},
  abstract = {Option pricing has become one of the quite important parts of the financial market. As the market is always dynamic, it is really difficult to predict the option price accurately. For this reason, various machine learning techniques have been designed and developed to deal with the problem of predicting the future trend of option price. In this paper, we compare the effectiveness of Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models for the prediction of option price. Both models are tested with a benchmark publicly available dataset namely SPY option price-2015 in both testing and training phases. The converted data through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used in both models to achieve better prediction accuracy. On the other hand, the entire dataset is partitioned into two groups of training (70%) and test sets (30%) to avoid overfitting problem. The outcomes of the SVM model are compared with those of the ANN model based on the root mean square errors (RMSE). It is demonstrated by the experimental results that the ANN model performs better than the SVM model, and the predicted option prices are in good agreement with the corresponding actual option prices.},

  title={Short term forecasting with support vector machines and application to stock price prediction},
  abstract = {Forecasting a stock price movement is one of the most difficult problems in finance. The reason is that financial time series are complex, non stationary. Furthermore, it is also very difficult to predict this movement with parametric models. Instead of parametric models, we propose two techniques, which are data driven and non parametric. Based on the idea that excess returns would be possible with publicly available information, we developed two models in order to forecast the short term price movements by using technical indicators. Our assumption is that the future value of a stock price depends on the financial indicators although there is no parametric model to explain this relationship. This relationship comes from the technical analysis. Comparison shows that support vector regression (SVR) out performs the multi layer perceptron (MLP) networks for a short term prediction in terms of the mean square error. If the risk premium is used as a comparison criterion, then the SVR technique is as good as the MLP method or better.},

However, the ARIMA model cannot easily capture the nonlinear patterns. Support vector machines (SVMs), a novel neural network technique, have been successfully applied in solving nonlinear regression estimation problems. Therefore, this investigation proposes a hybrid methodology that exploits the unique strength of the ARIMA model and the SVMs model in forecasting stock prices problems. Real data sets of stock prices were used to examine the forecasting accuracy of the proposed model. The results of computational tests are very promising.},

  abstract = {Recurrent neural networks like the long short-term memory (LSTM), and support vector machines (SVM) have been widely adopted to predict the price movements of stocks in China or other countries in recent years no matter the underlying stock is of low or high volatility, that is typically less or very fluctuating in its daily returns over a specific period of time. In this work, different performance measures of the LSTM and SVM are carefully analyzed and compared on a range of stocks exhibiting different volatilities. In addition, various data pre-processing techniques including the principal component analysis are utilized to enhance their overall performance. Surprisingly, the empirical results reveal that the overall performance of the original SVM excels on all stocks and also stocks of low volatility in the Shanghai Stock Exchange 50 (SSE 50) Index denoting the top 50 stocks listed on the Shanghai Exchange whereas the original LSTM consistently achieves the best overall performance of high-volatility stocks in the SSE 50 Index. More importantly, our work sheds light on numerous directions for future investigation.},

  abstract = {Stock Prediction provides wide area of Research which is revenue for the country and useful for day-to-day analysis. A lot of financial specialists performs predictive Analysis and finds the Market trends for their business. Analysts uses this Prediction for long time because of its unpredictable, composite, and consistently varying in character which was very hard to build solid expectations. This work proposes a methodology towards the expectation of pattern matching using AI methods like Random Forest and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The Random Forest method is a group learning strategy which is an extremely effective method for order & relapse. Support vector mechanism is an AI representation for the order and this model is generally utilized for arrangement. These procedures are utilized to determine whether the cost of stock will be higher than its cost on a given day to make profitable trading strategies. The main aim of this work is to create and evaluate a stock price predictor to make profitable trading strategies using AI and Data mining approaches.},

  abstract = {The time series forecasting system can be used for investments in a safe environment with minimized chances of loss. The Holt–Winters algorithm followed various procedures and observed the multiple factors applied to the neural network. The final module helps filter the system to predict the various factors and provides a rating for the system. This research work uses real-time dataset of fifteen stocks as input into the system and, based on the data, predicts or forecasts future stock prices of different companies belonging to different sectors. The dataset includes approximately fifteen companies from different sectors and forecasts their results based on which the user can decide whether to invest in the particular company or not; the forecasting will give an accurate result for the customer investments.},

  abstract = {The key to successful stock market forecasting is achieving best results with minimum required input data. Given stock market model uncertainty, soft computing techniques are viable candidates to capture stock market nonlinear relations returning significant forecasting results with not necessarily prior knowledge of input data statistical distributions. This paper surveys more than 100 related published articles that focus on neural and neuro-fuzzy techniques derived and applied to forecast stock markets. Classifications are made in terms of input data, forecasting methodology, performance evaluation and performance measures used. Through the surveyed papers, it is shown that soft computing techniques are widely accepted to studying and evaluating stock market behavior.},
